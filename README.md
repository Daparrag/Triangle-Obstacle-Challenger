# Triangle-Obstacle-Challenger
You must find the shortest path starting from point A (home) to point B (workplace). A path is an ordered sequence of points connected one to another with a single and straight line. 


# The input file is made of several lines:

The first one contains 4 integers (Xs ; Ys;  Xf ; Yf) identifying the coordinates of the starting point (Xs ; Ys) and the finishing point (Xf ; Yf).
The second one contains the N number of obstacles. An obstacle is a triangle which vertexes are 3 couples of coordinates: (ax ; ay), (bx ; by), (cx ; cy). Obstacles may overlap.
Each of the following N lines indicates the vertexes of one obstacle.
Please note that a problem can be unsolvable, i.e. it is possible that there is no path to reach the destination. The perimeter of the obstacle is considered as part of the obstacle.
